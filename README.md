# 401-Lab-1

### 7/9/2022

This purpose of the work done today was to implement automated testing and ensure that the testing is also done on the github side. This should allow for testing to be done automatically, both on my machine and on Github. Once the tests are passed, the app will be automatically updated.

# 401-Lab-2

The purpose of this lab was to add some automated testing with error handlers which we created. There were some struggles getting the proper tests to work, but I did eventually get them able to work after some help from Luis Sandoval and Derek Douglas.
